        <h4>Opportunity Statement</h4>
        <p>If you've ever tried to find information about a wheeled vehicle on the internet, you may have noticed that
            while information is readily available, it's scattered throughout many sources, forums, wikis, and other
            data repositories. The goal of this API is to create a searchable library of relevant vehicle information,
            quickly accessible via the API infrastructure, with full CRUD functionality. Users will be able to access
            various information about a given vehicle (stats, mpg, short summary, etc.) and will be able to update it
            if any errors are found.</p>
